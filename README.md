## Cards

This project is a playground with react-redux, material-ui, it emulates an e-commerce (Big toy), displaying
a product list, allowing users to add items to cart, a checkout page that sum the prices of products added
to the cart and a "admin" page where you can add new products to product list

I began this project playing with material-ui demo, testing components, etc.. Then I saw the Card component 
and decided to do something that uses it. Then more ideas popped in my mind and this is the result =)
